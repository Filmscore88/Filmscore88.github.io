During my time here at FlatIron, I can honestly say that the most fun I had and also the most challenging times were building out the portfolio projects.  It can be sightly intimidating when you realize you have to build something from scratch, that eventhough you have learned from labs and lessons having to build something from start to finish is a whole different thing. 

In my opinion,  the confidence boost and technical skills learned while building a project are unmatched any other activity in the curriculum.  Thats is why I suggest that everyone should always be involved in one way or another in a project. Either a open source project, or an individual one, we should all be polishing off our skills and working out our neurons and building new neuropathways. 

Even though the labs in the learn.co curriculum do teach you aspects and are very helpful, they should always be supplemented on your own time by trying to build a small project based on what you learned, incorporating the skills and knowledge gathered from previous labs and exercises. 

If you consistenly do this throughout the course I know that it will have a tremendous impact on your ability to quickly adapt to the projects requirments and be able to at least do a lot more on your own than you would have been able to do.
