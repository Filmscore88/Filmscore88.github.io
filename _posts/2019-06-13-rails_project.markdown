Ruby on rails has been a great experience, and will continue to be.  It was very challenging to find exactly what tools to use to accomplish my goals, part of the struggle was not so much in understanding what I was doing but more so knowing what tools to use. 

Im sure that is a normal beginner user experience, and as time goes on, different developers adapt and get comfortable with their own set of tools to accomplish their goals.  

 For this project, i ended up not using a gem called devise, which helps facilitate the authentication process. I actually installed it on my first draft, but when i read the readme, i saw that it was highly suggested that if it was your first project to not use it.  Although it was harder and more demanding to do all the authenticating manually, at least I got a better sense of what was going on underneath the hood, and when the day comes that I perhaps use the gem devise I will more appreciate all the work it does for me.  For this project, I challenged myself, and i am glad i made . that decision. 
 
  It was similar to the experience with sinatra, when I did my sinatra project, i had to do so many things manually like routing and controller actions, which rails now make much easier for me. But i see the learning process is more effective in building up gradually to abstracting away more and more. 
	
	Overall, this is just the beginning, and I hope to build more complex applications and even add more to my already existing rails project.
