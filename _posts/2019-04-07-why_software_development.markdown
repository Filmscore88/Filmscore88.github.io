Im a piano composer, and writing music is not only my passion but it also is a gift that comes to me naturally.  I would have never imagined that the structure I use to write a song would carry over into the software development world.  I never was intrigued by computers,  neither was I someone you would call a "computer geek" who would tinker around with computers and explore what was behind the screen of a video game. So how did I end up at the Flatiron Software Engineering bootcamp? 

For the past few years,  I have been going to college and majoring in Music Composition, obviously following my passion. I began to question whether this was a practical career path that would lead to a solid career. After meeting many college grads who majored in Music, and hearing their horror stories of not finding jobs and carrying the burden of dept, I was conviced that I had to explore a different field even if I was not as passionate about as music. One of my good friends mentioned that he was exploring software development, and mentioned the growing demand for developers in the world. As technology is growing, businesses are in need of software developers. So I decided to explore this field, and get my feet wet. 

  Back in the fall of 2018, I began with a free 12week course on learning the programming language Java. A few weeks in I found myself spending 8 to 10 hours a day learning as much as I could. As well as learning more than I thought that I could. I knew shortly that programming is something that I could see myself doing for the rest of my life. I enjoyed the challenges as well as the room for creativity. After a few moths of working and polishing off my Java skills, I decided that I needed guidance into what would be the next  step for me to take. There are so many resources online, and that can be overwhelming , If you do not know what is the next step. Therefore I decided to go to a coding bootcamp and invest money into my future, as well as set a good foundation for my  career as a software developer. 
	
	The creative aspect of programming stood out the most for me. Coming from a background of musical composition, I felt confident in my ability to use my gift in creativity to contribute to the world of software development. Many times I find myself using the same principles I would use to write a song, to write a program. 
	   First, I try to write a simple melody, simple. First, I try to write simple code, simple. Then I add create the transitions in my song from one melody to the next, and finally I write the ending of the song. Similarly, after writing a simple logic to a program I am buidling, I then start adding the transitioning methods and or objects to compliment and tie together the basic logic ( melody) of the program. Finally, I make sure the code runs smoothly, and runs to the very end without errors. Im glad to be where I am at today as a Software development student at Flatiron School, and I hope to never stop learning.
